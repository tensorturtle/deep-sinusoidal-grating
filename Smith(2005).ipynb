    "There is nothing wrong with this study except the relation it draws to daily life. This research is bound to studying how human vision perception/categorization works under artificial, geometric conditions. And there are plenty of conditions like that to consider. However, I disagree with the authors when they say that `it seems possible that the results from different visual search tasks in different domains - both laboratory and ecological - will turn out to cross-generalize`. I think low-dimensional controlled research and environmental vision will be parallel, cross-pollinating, but not unifying, fields.\n",
